Here.  This is probably as close as it's going to get to the release version.
The game just won't work on >512K systems.  There is nothing I can do about
it since I don't have a >512K system to play on.  NitrOS-9 users should NOT
be having problems - this indicates that there is a BUG in the SS.ScInf call
of NitrOS-9, which I can do nothing about.  Sorry... Sigh.

Robert - here is 1.0
