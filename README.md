# Invaders09
Sub-Etha Software's Space Invaders-style game for CoCo 3 OS-9 L2 (1994).

Mount INVADE09.DSK in a CoCo 3 emulator (such as XRoar in CoCo 3 mode) and then type "DOS" to boot. This will boot in to NitrOS-9/6809 and then run Invaders09.

Special thanks to Jamie Cho for splitting up the original source file and automating the creation of the bootable disk image.
